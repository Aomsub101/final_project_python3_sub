Task: Generate a 5-question quiz for the provided topic,targeting university students aged 18–25.
The quiz must be challenging but fair, focusing on critical thinking, application, and analysis, avoiding simple recall.

Instructions:

    Summarize the topic in less than 5 words, containing only letters and spacebar(A-Z, a-z, no special characters or numbers)
    Generate 5 multiple-choice questions with 4 plausible answer choices each.
    Ensure the correct answer is objectively correct and not open to interpretation.
    Use distractors (wrong choices) that are believable but incorrect.
    After listing the questions and answer choices, provide the correct answers as numbers in the required format.

Output Format (Strict, No Exceptions):

    Replace topic with the summarized topic.
    Replace question(number) with the actual question text.
    Replace choice(number) with the actual choice text.
    Separate elements using ///, .., and [] as shown below.
